              Hi

              In Plankton Toolbox version 1.1 the Plankton counter module was added. You can use it when analysing e.g. phytoplankton samples using the Utermöhl method or for samples where the plankton has been concentrated using filtration.

              Nice picture and interesting question.
              I have never seen one alike.
              Could it be a Dinophysis sp. pictured from the side?
              Look at the picture at page 29 at [http://images.algaebase.org/algaebase/pdf/5964B9370591d2CDB8jqx16A773A/2...](http://images.algaebase.org/algaebase/pdf/5964B9370591d2CDB8jqx16A773A/24609.pdf)

              But the striae are not typical Dinophysis.

              I am also thinking in the line of benthic Dionophysis (or similar genera).

              I am also into Amphisolenia sp - maybe a specimen in very early stage (and hence much smaller). Look into Okolodokov at the Gulf of Mexico (an SEM picture of Amphisolenia has the same posterior structure as your specimen - two parallel horns)

              I stop here since I am feeling that I am trying to avoid my must-do analysis at the moment;-)

              Let us know if you solve the problem

          I´ve found a dinoflagellate that I can´t put a name on. I first found it in a channel in Landskrona in mid June, with a salt water inlet. I found it later in the south of Öresund from mid July. Always with two spines.

              I think I can see 3 spines one that is between the two that are truly visible?! The third one is close to the left one but a little fuzzy maybe from being out of focus. Maybe this is not true but I do think that if it has three spines I could name it but not untill I am wotk as I do not remember the name....

              The dinoflagellate is very similar to a freshwater species complex, Peridinium umbonatum. This species is also observed in brackish water with low salinity.

          Hello
          This one tricks me (among many others):
          Location Korsfjorden, Tröndelag, Norway, September 2013.

          Suggestions:

          Amphidoma caudata (acc. Throndsen, Hasle & Tangen; Phytoplankton in Norwegian coastal seas)
          - but that drawing has more rounded ends

          Oxytoxum criophilum (acc. to drawing in Phytoplankton in Norwegian coastal seas)
          - but

          corythodinium diploconus (acc Dodge - Marine dinoflagellates of the British Isles)
          - very similar drawing and description. And reported from Norwegian waters.

          Maybe...(I found this paper in this very moment)
          Gómez, Fernando, Hervé Claustre, and Sami Souissi. 2008. “Rarely Reported Dinoflagellates of the Genera Ceratium, Gloeodinium, Histioneis, Oxytoxum and Prorocentrum (Dinophyceae) from the Open Southeast Pacific Ocean.” Rev. Biol. Mar. Oceanogr 43: 25–40.
          their fig 10/11
          (10) Oxytoxum elegans. (11) Oxytoxum tesselatum.

          My working hypothesis is then no. 11.
          Oxytoxum tesselatum

          No reports in Nordic Micoralgae.
          HAve any of you litterature on the genus?
          New species to Norway?

          Please add comments and ideas

          Merry christmas

              Fredric, your picture makes me think about Chaetoceros decipiens or C.lorenzianus, but their setae should originate at the valve edge and lie in the apical plane, and in the picture it looks like intercalary setae originate outside the valva edge?-am I right?. Try to find also chloroplasts number: wighamii has 1, decipiens and lorenzianus have 4-10. C.wighamii should have teminal setae diverge in a long S-shaped curve more or less parallel tothe chain axis.

              Thank you for your answer.
              I will re-evaluate it later on.
              But do you have any good ideas on how to distinguish chloroplast numbers in lugol-samples?
              I find it very tricky,

          Hi
          Has anyone the literature for distinguishing A. longicornis and A. septentrionalis?
          In Throndsen, Hasle and Tangen "Phytoplankton och Norwegian coastal waters" they distinguish it by the ratio between apical-axis and length of horns.
          But in this database we cite another source using a different character.
          I append this species, which I presume is Attheya longicornis before publishing to the database.

          Dear

          This dinoflagellate was in the plankton sample from today. When trying to identify it later on, I couldnt find any similar species.
          One possible organism could be Gyrodinium pellucidum (in Dodge, Marine Dinoflagellates of the British Isles, fig 11 j). But the sulcus is not as broad as in the Dodge and neither fits well to the occurence in the Pacific and Barents Sea.

          The Danish planktonbook (Plankton i de indre danske farvande) also have some similar Gymnodinium in. ed. sp 2. (Fig 4.37 v). They also note that such dinos can be sexual stages to larger ones.

          Any ideas?

          The picture can be viewd at

          dear
          I uploaded this Monosiga marina.
          species identified using Throndsen, Hasle and Tangen "Phytoplankton of Norwegian coastal waters" p. 282.
          But I did not use the variety name. M. marina var. marina. My argument is that we have no idea about varietes contra real species and hence I exclude varieties.
          Has anyone comments on this (or the identification)?

          Can we append movie sequences to the species information? Or could that be done?

          I do have a small video on euglenoid movements in Eutreptiella braarudii, that would be nice to show.

              We will soon (in 2 weeks) be able to append movie sequences to the species information. It will be in a way that you link to youtube and paste the YoutubeID (11 characters, in your case:SSUGO9rPGwI) instead of uploading sequences to the webpage.  When this will be possible we will show that on "recent news".

              regards Malin
